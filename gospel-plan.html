            <h2>The Gospel Plan of Salvation</h2>
            <p>The gospel is the good news about Jesus Christ, His life, death, and resurrection. It is the foundation of Christian faith.</p>
            <p>According to the Bible, all humans have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). The consequence of sin is death, both physical and spiritual (Romans 6:23). However, God, in His love and mercy, provided a way for salvation through Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Jesus lived a sinless life and willingly died on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins. Through His death and resurrection, He conquered sin and death, offering eternal life to all who believe in Him (John 3:16).</p>
            <p>To receive this gift of salvation, one must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hear the message of the gospel (Romans 10:17)</li>
                <li>Believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior (Acts 16:31)</li>
                <li>Repent of sins (Acts 2:38)</li>
                <li>Confess faith in Jesus (Romans 10:9)</li>
                <li>Be baptized for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Salvation is a free gift from God, not earned by works but received through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9). Those who accept this gift are promised eternal life and a restored relationship with God.</p>
